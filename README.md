# Human judgment forecasts of human monkeypox transmission and burden

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to present and store human judgment forecasts of transmission and burden of the monkeypox virus (MPXV). 
Questions related to human monkeypox and MXPV are hosted by [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/).
Metadata about the questions posed to the crowd can be found in `metadata.csv`.
Ensemble forecast data is stored in two csv files: `communitypredictions.csv` and `communiityquantiles.csv`  

## Make
There is a `Makefile` included in this repository that downlloads all ensemble forecasts from the Metaculus API and creates figures that were used in the associated manuscript.
